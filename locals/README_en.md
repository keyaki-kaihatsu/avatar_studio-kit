# Overview

Using this project, you can import Unity prefabs into Keyaki Studio by leveraging Unity's AssetBundle functionality.

# Environment

**Unity**
```bash
 Version   >>>  Unity 6 (6000.0.25f1)
 Platform  >>>  iOS, Android, Windows, macOS
```

**VRM**

By converting VRM files (avatar files) into AssetBundles, you can achieve better performance than directly using VRM files. To convert VRM files to AssetBundles, import the **VRM1.0** Unity package.
<br>
https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/releases

# Usage

1. Create a new Unity project and import the Unity package.

2. In the Project window, right-click any prefab. From the menu, select "KeyakiStudio > Asset Build (From Prefab)."

<br>
・ Asset Build (From Prefab)
<br>
<small>
    ∟ Converts a prefab into an AssetBundle. Copy the entire generated folder into the app's `assets` folder.
</small>
<br>
<br>
・ Avatar Asset Build (From VRM)
<br>
<small>
    ∟ Converts VRM files into AssetBundles. Copy the entire generated folder into the app's `vrm_files` folder. 
    <br>
    ∟ Use this feature if you experience poor performance when loading VRoidHub or VRM files.
</small>
<br>
<br>
・ Animation Asset Build (From VRM Prefab + Animation)
<br>
<small>
    ∟ Converts VRM with animations into AssetBundles. Copy the entire generated folder into the app's `animations` folder. 
    <br>
    ∟ Use this feature if you experience poor performance when loading animation files (FBX, GLB).
    <br>
    ∟ Set the desired animation as the default state in the Animator's AnimationController, and configure the `MotionTime` parameter in motion time.
</small>
<br>
<br>

<br>
・ Convert Animation (From .txt)
<br>
<small>
    ∟ This is not an AssetBuild feature. It converts trace files (.txt) generated by the app into AnimationClips.
    <br>
    ∟ Generate trace files by pressing and holding the `Trace` button in the app's `Editing screen > Avatar panel > Export AnimationClip Data`.
</small>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Enter the required information in the dialog. If no additional settings are needed, press the "Build" button.
<br>

<br>
・ Specify the build output directory.
<br>
・ Enter the asset name. (optional)
<br>
・ Select the target OS for the asset. (optional)
<br>
・ Enable ZIP compression if needed. Be sure to extract the ZIP on the target device. (optional)
<br>
<br>
4. After converting a prefab to an AssetBuild, the output will be saved in the folder specified in #1 of the dialog. Transfer the entire output folder to a device with Keyaki Studio installed using AirDrop, Google Drive, etc.
<br>
Copy them into the app's `assets` folder.
