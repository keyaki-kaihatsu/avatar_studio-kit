# Overview

This project lets you import Unity prefabs into Keyaki Studio by using Unity's AssetBundle feature.

# Environment

**Unity**

```bash
 Version   >>>  Unity 2022.3.61f1
 Platform  >>>  iOS, Android, Windows, macOS
```

**VRM**

Converting VRM files (avatar files) to AssetBundles improves performance compared to using VRM files directly. To do this, import the **VRM1.0** unitypackage.
<br>
https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/releases

# How to Use

1. Create a new Unity project and import the unitypackage.

2. In the Project window, right-click any prefab and select "KeyakiStudio > Asset Build (From Prefab)" from the menu.

<br>
・ Asset Build (From Prefab)
<br>
<small>
    ∟ Converts the prefab into an AssetBundle. Copy the entire output folder to the app's assets folder.
</small>
<br>
<br>
・ Avatar Asset Build (From VRM)
<br>
<small>
    ∟ Converts a VRM file into an AssetBundle. Copy the output folder to the app's vrm_files folder.
    <br>
    ∟ Use this if loading VRoidHub or VRM files is slow.
</small>
<br>
<br>
・ Animation Asset Build (From VRM Prefab + Animation)
<br>
<small>
    ∟ Converts a VRM prefab with animation into an AssetBundle. Copy the output folder to the app's animations folder.
    <br>
    ∟ Use this if loading animation files (FBX/GLB) is slow.
    <br>
    ∟ Set your desired animation as the default in the Animator's AnimationController, and set the "MotionTime" parameter for motion time.
</small>
<br>
<br>

<br>
・ Convert Animation (From .txt)
<br>
<small>
    ∟ This does not create an AssetBundle. It converts trace files (.txt) generated by the app into AnimationClips.
    <br>
    ∟ In the app: Go to Edit screen > Avatar panel > Export AnimationClip data, then long-press the trace button to generate a trace file. This can be output as an AnimationClip and Animation.Controller.
</small>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Fill in the dialog as needed. If you don't need to change any settings, just press the "Build" button.
<br>
<br>
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="https://avatar-studio.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/avatar_studio-kit/readme/feature-06.png" style="display: block; width: 40%;">
</div>
<br>
・ Enter the build output destination.
<br>
・ Enter the asset name (optional).
<br>
・ Select the target device OS (optional).
<br>
・ Enable ZIP compression if needed. Be sure to extract the ZIP on the target device (optional).
<br>

## Upload

### Copy to Folder

After building, the output will be in the folder you specified in step #1 of the dialog.
<br>
Send the entire output folder to a device with Keyaki Studio installed (using AirDrop, Google Drive, etc).
<br>
Copy the folder to the "Keyaki Studio > assets" folder.

### Use MyAssets

MyAssets is a website for downloading assets to the app via the cloud. Log in to the MyAssets site, get your access code (\*1), and enter it in the app.
<br>

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <img src="https://avatar-studio.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/avatar_studio-kit/readme/feature-10.png" style="display: block; width: 40%;">
</div>
<br>
(*1) Issue an access code like "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXX" from the MyAssets screen.
<br>
MyAssets → <a href="https://keyaki-studio.onrender.com/" target="_blank">https://keyaki-studio.onrender.com/</a>
<br>
<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 12px; overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; padding: 12px 0px;">
  <img src="https://avatar-studio.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/avatar_studio-kit/readme/feature-11.png" style="display: block; border-radius: 12px;">
</div>
<br>
<br>

# Notes

- Scripts and shaders cannot be built as AssetBundles.
- Asset names must be unique.
